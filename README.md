# rc.local

Brings back `/etc/rc.local` functionality to newer SystemD based Linux

## Why rc.local?

Because having a single, simple shell script to launch key functions
when spinning up a new machine makes life so much easier than dealing
with nuances of creating different SystemD service files for every service
you might need run.
